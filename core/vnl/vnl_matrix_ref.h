//: vnl_matrix reference to user-supplied storage
//    vnl_matrix_ref is a vnl_matrix for which the data space has been
//    supplied externally.  This is useful for two main tasks:
//    (a) Treating some row-based "C" matrix as a vnl_matrix in order to
//    perform vnl_matrix operations on it.
//    (b) Declaring a vnl_matrix that uses stack-based storage for the
//    matrix (See MatrixFixed).  Note however that the rows are still allocated
//    on the heap.  See MatrixFixed for a fully stack-based solution.
//
//    This is a dangerous class.  I believe that I've covered all the bases, but
//    it's really only intended for interfacing with the Fortran routines.
//
//    The big warning is that returning a vnl_matrix_ref pointer will free non-heap
//    memory if deleted through a vnl_matrix pointer.  This should be
//    very difficult though, as vnl_matrix_ref objects may not be constructed using
//    operator new, and are therefore unlikely to be the unwitting subject
//    of an operator delete.

// fsm: This was wrong for two reasons:
//  1. operator new may not return a null pointer.
//  2. it should be enabled for compilers that need it,
//     not disabled for compilers that don't need it.
