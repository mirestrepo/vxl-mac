An example of what the syntax for documentation looks like can be found
in vxl_doc_rules.[h,cxx]


To generate the entire documentation with doxygen
(http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen):

1. Look into Doxyfile and change the path to the source if needed
 (INPUT, EXCLUDE, STRIP_FROM_PATH)

2. You might want to switch on LATEX and MAN
 (GENERATE_LATEX = "YES", GENERATE_MAN = "YES")

3. Make sure doxygen is in your path

4. Type "doxygen Doxyfile"




To generate the documentation for the example vxl_doc_rules.[h,cxx]:

1. Make sure doxygen is in your path

2. Type "doxygen Doxyfile_for_vxl_doc_rules"
