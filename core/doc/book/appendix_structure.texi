The directory structure of @vxl{} is below
@example
  $VXLSRC/vcl
          vcl/config.$BUILD
          vxl/vnl
             /vul
             /vbl
             /vil
             /vgl
             /vsl
@end example

@section Other modules

On the repository and some @vxl{} distributions, you will find several other
modules beside vcl and vxl.


@cindex gel
@cindex oxl
@cindex mul
@cindex tbl

@table @samp
@item gel
Published libraries from General Electric's Corporate Research Department.
@item oxl
Published libraries from the Robots Research
Group at Oxford University.
@item mul
Published libraries from Imaging Science and Biomedical Engineering
at the University of Manchester.
@item tbl
A set of image processing libraries.
@item conversions
A set of routines for converting between various @vxl{} and non-@vxl{} types.
@end table

These modules are presented as useful code, with even less guarantees
than @vxl{},
(which is not to suggest that we guarantee anything about @vxl{}.)
In particular
they may not work as advertised. They may not be documented. If you find them
useful, and think they deserve full @vxl{}-status please contact the library's
author to see about having the code tidied up and promoted to @vxl{}.

You can find any overview documentation about these modules from the @vxl{}
homepage.

@section CVS Repository

The VXL repository is provided by SourceForge - Thanks guys! You
can get details of how to obtain the up-to-date CVS snapshot from
@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/vxl/}

Unfortunately there is an
extra @code{vxl/} in the repository's directory tree. This means
that if you check out vxl from @code{/home/work/myvxl} you will
get everything from the VXL repository including vxl/vcl,
vxl/vxl, vxl/gel, etc. This also means that your vxl root
directory will be @code{/home/work/myvxl/vxl}, and
@code{vnl_matrix.h} will be in
@code{/home/work/myvxl/vxl/vxl/vnl/vnl_matrix.h}.
Until SF provide a simple means of editing the Repositories directly,
it is too much effort to remove the extra @code{vxl/} - sorry.
