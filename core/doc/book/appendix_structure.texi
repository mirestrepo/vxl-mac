@section Basic structure

The directory structure of @vxl{} is below
@example
  $VXLSRC/vcl
          vxl/vnl
             /vul
             /vbl
             /vil
             /vgl
             /vsl
             @dots{}
          v3p/netlib
             /jpeg
             @dots{}
          config.cmake
@end example

@table @samp
@item vcl
is the C++ compatibility layer (@pxref{vcl}).

@item  vxl
contains the core @vxl{} libraries.

@item v3p
(v-third-party) contains code that is available elsewhere and is used
in implementing @vxl{}. @code{v3p/netlib} contains cleaned-up C
versions of the high-quality Fortran code. @code{v3p/jpeg} and others
contain image file format code used by vil. In theory, you don't need
any of of the v3p libraries if you have locally installed versions. In
practice, you need @code{v3p/netlib} but not the others.  the

@item config.cmake
contains the configuration files used by the CMake build system
(@pxref{CMake}).

@end table

These modules are presented as useful code, with even less guarantees
than @vxl{} (which is not to suggest that we guarantee anything about
@vxl{}).  In particular they may not work as advertised. They may not
be documented. If you find them useful, and think they deserve full
@vxl{}-status please contact the library's author to see about having
the code tidied up and promoted to @vxl{}.

You can find any overview documentation about these modules from the
@uref{http://vxl.sourceforge.net/,vxl homepage} by following the
``documentation'' link.

@section CVS Repository

The VXL repository is provided by SourceForge---Thanks guys! The
instructions for downloading @vxl{} are documented at
