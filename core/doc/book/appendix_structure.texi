The directory structure of VXL is below
@example
  $IUEROOT/vcl
           vcl/config.$BUILD
           vxl/vnl
              /vul
              /vbl
              /vil
              /vgl
              /vsl
          /config
          /Scripts
@end example
The last two directories are part of the IUE/TargetJr makefiles so are
not needed by those using Visual Studio or their own build systems.
