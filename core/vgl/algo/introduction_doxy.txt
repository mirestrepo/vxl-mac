/*! \mainpage vgl_algo : Computational Geometry Library
*
* The vgl-algo library contains functions to perform elementary geometric
*operations like intersecting two lines, finding the nearest point on a line or a conic,
*computing the cross ratio of four points, lines or planes.
*
* For convenience, this functionality is put in a "name space", separate for 2D and 3D,
* and separate for cartesian and homogeneous representations.
*
* All representation classes are templated on the computational numeric type.
*
* \section Lead Developer
* Peter Vanroose is responsible for co-ordinating significant changes to vgl_algo.
