//: OpenGL utility to render a vil1_image.
//
//  This is not a tableau.
//
//  The image_renderer provides an easy way to render sections of an
//  image. It should manage possibly sub-sampled buffers internally
//  to provide a reasonable trade-off between memory consumption and
//  rendering speed. For a very large image, which cannot be stored
//  in core, locally panning the image should not be too slow because
//  sections can be cached at various levels of resolution.
//
//  It is assumed that the image is located on the plane z=0 and that
//  image pixel indices i,j (i is the column index, j the row index)
//  describe the x,y-locations of the rendered pixels. It is currently
//  undefined where the centre of a pixel is placed.
//
//  Note that the class keeps a vil1_image (as given), so if the
//  underlying image is modified after sections have been taken by
//  this class, inconsistent rendering may result. Call need_resection()
//  to mark all previous sections as invalid.
