  <li>Pointer indexing rather than arithmetic indexing
  <ul>
    <li>Pointers are slower than arithmetic on most modern platforms</li>

  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <code>vil1_image</code> smart pointer stuff is confusing.
  <ul>
    <li>Is it a view, is it a smart ptr, is it a smart smart ptr?</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>There are some fundamental divisions</h2>

<p>Do these not indicate that trying to have a single image type (or hierarchy) is incorrect? 
Does the single <code>vil1_image</code> hierarchy actually give you anything?</p>
<p>vil merges all the assumptions on the left in <code>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;</code>, 
and those on the right in <code>vil_image_resource</code></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Before ISBE, Manchester adopted VXL we used an image type which provided</p>
<ol>
  <li>Good plane support</li>
  <li>Arithmetic indexing, exposed in the interface</li>
  <li>A world to image transform</li>
  <li>A polymorphic class hierarchy whose base class could represent images of 
  any dimension.</li>
</ol>
<p>We heavily used all these features, none of which were available in vil1. To 
get round this problem we wrote our own public VXL-compatible image library - 
mul/mil. It did all the above stuff, using vil1 to do the file loading and 
saving. We also designed the library in terms of views of images. We first 
informally raised the idea of rewriting vil1 to support our code at the Zurich 
VXL meeting in March 2001, with encouraging responses. After spending 18 months 
noticing that we were duplicating more and more code that was available in vil1, 
the short-notice arrangement of a meeting in Providence on the 27th Sep 2002, 
and the encouraging comments from other VXL members gave us the spur to design 
this proposal.</p>
<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p>We want a single "normal" and "easy" image class that we can point new users at.
This should also be the default class for doing actual pixel manipulation.</p>
<p>We want to keep the type proliferation down. So we enforce the following idea
<code>vil_image_resource_sptr</code> is used when you don't know an image's pixel type,
and you can't immediately access the pixels.
<code>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;</code> is used when you know the type,
you know the structure and you can immediately access the pixels. By keeping this
division clean we can avoid type proliferation. There are limited exceptional cases. One is
when you absolutely must have a function that works on a view without knowing its pixel type - e.g.
<code>vil_image_resource::get_view()</code> which returns a <code>vil_image_view_base_sptr</code>.
This means that all functions that actually work with pixels should
take a concrete <code>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;</code>. Anyone who wants to write super-duper 
size-no-problem image processing code, should write functions that take 
<code>vil_image_resource_sptr</code>. However they will do the actual pixel processing with a 
<code>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;</code>. To get the functional style, most operations on a
<code>vil_image_resource</code>, should be on a <code>vil_image_resource_sptr</code>.</p>
<h2>Design decisions:</h2>
<h4><code>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;::set_size(..)</code> should be virtual and in the base class</h4>
<p>It is 
  in <code>mil_image_2d</code>. Resizing can be slow so virtual function is no problem. It can 
be useful to set the size of a image without knowing its type. Decision IMS and 
TFC.</p>
<h4><code>vil_memory_chunk</code> should not be templated.</h4>
<p>You could have a memory chunk containing rgb, and choose to view it as
a <code>vil_image_view&lt;vil_rgb&lt;vxl_byte&gt;&gt;</code> with nplanes=1, or 
<code>vil_image_view&lt;char&gt;</code> with nplanes =3; It
is hard to get the type of the smart pointers correct without linking the types 
T of the <code>vil_memory_chunk&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;</code>. 
We can put a image type in a member variable if it is necessary (e.g. for vsl 
IO). Decision IMS and TFC.</p>
<h4>Use (i, j, p) default names for index parameters, and <code>ni()</code>, 
<code>nj()</code>, <code>nplanes()</code>, for 
sizes.</h4>
<p>Want to avoid use of (x,y) to avoid giving the impression that pixels are in a
Cartesian co-ord system. It is good to link index name and size name to avoid 
for loop mistakes. Alternative was row, col, plane, and rows, cols, and planes. 
Inner loops should have short variable names. Decision at Providence meeting.</p>
<h4>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt; should have a sparse interface.</h4>
<p>Methods like <code>set_to_window(..)</code>, <code>flip_ud()</code>,
<code>transpose()</code>,
can all be provided as standalone functions without much addition overhead.
Class API's should be be small rather than large. Use Doxygen's <code>\relates</code> option
to help users find related functions. Decision IMS.</p>
<h4>Using arithmetic indexing scheme</h4>
<p><code>i.e.<br>
vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;::operator(i,j,p) {return *(top_left_ptr + i * istep + j* jstep + p*planestep);}</code><br>
Don't use pointer indexing.<br>
<code>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;::operator(i,j) {return raster_ptrs[j][i];}<br>
</code>Multiplication is fast on modern processors. Pointers require extra 
memory lookup which is slower, and can reduce cache hit rate. Pointers do not 
generalise well to planes, or 3D. Decision confirmed at Providence meeting.</p>
<h4>Best order for index parameters is i,j,plane.</h4>
<p>There is no preferred indexing order with arithmetic indexing. You don't know 
whether the planestep is 1 or istep is 1. However, for ease of use it is worth 
having a consistent interface. Two alternatives are (plane, i, j) and (i, j, plane). 
The former is probably more natural, however, the latter allows us to use 
default argument plane=0, which is very useful for keeping interface clutter 
down. Decision at Providence meeting.</p>
<h4>Use <code>vil_image_view_base_sptr</code> in preference to <code>vil_image_view_base *</code>.</h4>
<p>Main uses of this are in <code>vil_load(..)</code> and <code>vil_image_resource::get_view(..)</code>.
These functions cannot return a real vil_image_view&lt;T&gt; because that would
involve knowing T in advance. They cannot return references because the real
object will get destroyed as the function ends before it is assigned to a
variable in the calling level. We use the smart over the raw pointer to avoid a
likely source of memory leaks. However, most code in vil should operate on
<code>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;</code>.
Decision at Providence meeting.</p>
<h4><code>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;</code> should not be derived from <code>vil_image_resource</code></h4>
<p>As explained above these are actually two different types. Efficient access 
to ni, nj for <code>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;</code> whilst matching interface for
<code>vil_image_resource</code> would require a lot of complexity.
Decision confirmed at Providence meeting.</p>
<h4>There should  be no general <code>vil_image_resource::set_properties(..)</code>?</h4>
<p>Its existence would imply the ability to set arbitrary properties. You can always have a
specialist <code>set_obscure_tiff_property(..)</code> as a member function of 
<code>vil_tiff_file_image</code>. Decision by IMS and AWF. There will be a
<code>vil_image_resource::get_properties(..)</code> with all properties documented 
in <code>vil/vil_properties.h</code>. This allows for partially shared 
properties such as bits per component or physical pixel height
</p>
<h4><code>vil_image_resource::get_view(..)</code>, etc. will not allow you to specify planes.</h4>
<p>It is easy to split off individual planes later. Although plane 
specifications could give 
you a memory advantage -  a factor of 3 is not big enough to be useful 
for v. large images. Not having planes specifications can make programming
<code>vil_file_image_resource::get_view(..)</code>, 
etc. a lot easier and potentially faster.
Decision at Providence meeting.</p>
<h4>Index and size types should be <code>unsigned int</code>.</h4>
<p>Signed has the advantage that it is much easier to pick up -ne overflow 
errors. Unsigned has the advantage that it is more natural, makes the fixed 0,0 
origin clear, and it reduces the number of assertion checks needed (admittedly 
by exposing you to the -ne overflow errors:) We can catch some -ne overflow 
errors by <code>assert&nbsp;(i != (unsigned)(-1))</code>. Decision at Providence 
meeting.</p>
<h4>Use function overloading and normal filename prefix for functions on <code>
vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;</code>, and functions on 
<code>vil_image_resource</code> objects.</h4>
<p>Where function overloading doesn't discriminate (e.g.
<code>vil_load(&quot;filename&quot;)</code> ) then use
<code>vil_load_image_resource(&quot;filename&quot;)</code> 
for <code>vil_image_resource</code> objects. Decision IMS and TFC</p>
<h4><code>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;::set_size(ni, nj)</code> will make no changes if size is same.
It will detach from original underlying data and create new data if different.</h4>
<p>This has some odd effects. If you have multiple views to the same data then 
set_size may or may not move view to different data. However, it is very useful 
when treating views as ordinary images, and allows very efficient use of 
workspace images. For example multiple calls to an image processing class often 
need identically sized image workspaces. Using this set_size means that it doesn't 
have to reallocate memory on a regular basis. <code>mil_image</code> has been 
using this design for 18 months with no problems. Decision at Providence meeting.</p>
<h4><code>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;::operator=()</code> can be smart but should do fast view transforms only.</h4>
<p>Allowing <br>
<code>vil_image_view&lt;vil_rgb&lt;vxl_byte&gt; &gt; im_rgb(ni, nj);<br>
vil_image_view&lt;vxl_byte&gt; im_planes = im_rgb;</code><br>
and<br>
<code>vil_image_view&lt;vil_rgb&lt;vxl_byte&gt;&gt; pnm = vil_load(&quot;filename.ppm&quot;);</code><br>
makes for easy use. However , expensive operations should not have short 
names. So this should not include doing conversions such as byte to float 
conversion. These conversions should be done by separately named functions. 
Decision at Providence meeting.</p>
<h4><code>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;::operator=()</code> should take base class and base class
sptr.</h4>
<p>Equals is defined as <code>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;::operator=(const 
vil_image_view_base &amp;</code>. This is an operator= from its own base class.
This doesn't appear to cause any problems, and allows the above fast view
transformations between pixel types. Additionally
<code>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;::operator=(const vil_image_view_base_sptr &amp;)</code>
allows for the simple conversion from the the return value of many functions
such as vil_load. These need to return base class sptrs to reduce memory leaks
and because their interface cannot know the pixel type. Decision IMS</p>
<h4>Should <code>vil_load</code>  should return a base class sptr.</h4>
<p>(Similarly <code>vil_image_resource::get_view(..)</code>)
They could return <code>vil_image_view_base *</code> or <code>vil_image_view_sptr</code> 
Both appear to work. The smart pointer version has the advantage of not needing
users to be careful about deletion. Decision by consensus on the reflector.</p>
<h4>All pixel types should be explicit about type length (e.g. <code>vxl_uint_16</code>)</h4>
<p>Alternative is to have <code>vil_image_resource::get_view()</code> automatically 
pick the best standard type for that platform (e.g. short) The problem with this 
becomes clear on 64 bit platforms. What types should 16bit or 32bit data get 
loaded into (The same platform can't define short as both.). Decision at 
Providence meeting. Question - do the float types need to be specific or can 
we assume IEEE standard lengths?&nbsp;</p>
<h4>All operations will default to scalar pixels and multiple planes.
<code>vil_image_resource</code> hierarchy will mostly work only with scalar pixels.</h4>
<p>Nothing prevents you from using <code>vil_rgb</code> pixels, and we will 
provide appropriate support. However planes are more general than components, 
and <code>vil_image_resource</code> hierarchy can be simpler if it only thinks 
about scalar pixels. In particular it may not be feasible to consider every
possible compound pixel type in a <code>switch()</code> statement, but it is
feasible to consider every possible scalar pixel type.
Decision confirmed at Providence meeting.</p>
<h4>Base class image type polymorphic in dimension and pixel type, and containing
world to image transforms will be provided in a separate level2 library - vimt.</h4>
<p>vimt benefits from being able to use both vil and vgl (and possibly vnl). 
Decision TFC.</p>
<h4>All standard image processing algorithms will go into vil/algo</h4>
<p>We will dump the vipl interface. All image processing code would be written 
in terms of <code>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;</code> first. Then write another function 
which uses the first function, but does all the stitching stuff. Decision at 
Providence meeting.</p>
<h4>All vil/algo image processing functions will have their input images as the 
first parameters.</h4>
<p>e.g. <code>vil_sobel&lt;T&gt;(const vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;&amp;source, vil_image_view&lt;T&gt; 
&amp;dest_i, vil_image_view&lt;T&gt; &amp;dest_j);</code></p>
<p>This is different from the operator=(..) style, but is more common in other 
function libraries. Decision at Providence meeting.</p>
<h4>Best names are <code>vil_image_view, vil_image_resource</code></h4>
<p>A beginner will expect to 
see the word image in the main image type. However it aids understanding to be
reminded that this is a view so <code>vil_image_view</code>. <code>vil_image_resource</code>
was originally <code>vil_image_data</code>. However that was thought to be
confusing and might get confused with the <code>vil_memory_chunk</code> class.
So <code>vil_image_resource</code>. Decision at Providence meeting and by vote
on vxl-maintainers.</p>
<h4>Use <code>set_size(..)</code> rather than <code>resize(..)</code>.</h4>
<p>The STL has introduced the notion of a data preserving resize. Since our code
doesn't do that, we use <code>set_size(..)</code> instead. Decision
Amitha and consensus on the reflector.</p>
<h4>raster and plane step types should be <code>vcl_ptrdiff_t</code>.</h4>
<p>This is strictly the correct type to add to a pointer to get another pointer.
It isn't signed int on platforms with 64-bit address bus but 32-bit data.
Decision IMS.</p>
<h4><code>vcl_complex&lt;float&gt;</code> is a scalar pixel type.</h4>
<p>Whilst useful under certain circumstances, it is not sensible default
behaviour to allow vil to treat a complex&lt;float&gt; as a two plain float
image. Therefore <code>vil_image_resource</code> derivatives should treat
complex&lt;float&gt; as ones of its default pixel types. Decision - FW and IMS.</p>
<h4><code>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;</code> should have a constructor which allows
interleaved or separated plane storage.</h4>
<p>This is the single most useful specialist memory format for a view, and so
deserves to be easily created. Decision PVr and IMS.</p>
<h2>Remaining questions</h2>
<p>There is now no way to get a bit-compressed pbm file into memory efficiently. Is this a problem?
We could solve it by deriving a <code>vil_image_view_of_compressed_bits</code>, or similar.</p>
<h2>Proposal Adoption</h2>
<p>vil2 has been adopted and is now called vil.</p>
<p>The Providence meeting unanimously agreed to adopt a fleshed out, tested and 
documented version 
of vil2. It will go in after release 1.0.</p>
<p>Manchester will write a guide/example of how to  write code that will work 
with the existing vil1, and convert easily to vil2 before the 1.0 release.</p>
<p>Manchester agreed to write all the necessary code to get their private 
libraries working with vil2. Others will write missing stuff that they need.</p>
<p>The level of functionality needed before promotion to full VXL status is all 
Manchester code working, plus a good <code>vil_convolve</code> implementation, 
and a TIFF file loader.</p>
<p>The adoption process will work as follows.</p>
<ol>
  <li>All code in vil1 that is needed by vil2 will be copied to vil2.</li>
  <li>Manchester will release scripts to help automate conversion of use of vil1 
  to use of vil2.</li>
  <li>All code in repository will be converted, everyone pitching in with their 
  own modules.</li>
  <li>Once that is done,  anyone who is following the repository will be given a 
  limited period to convert 
  their own code.</li>
  <li>vil1 will be renamed to vil1 and given a wrapper to allow it to be used to 
  load unconverted image types.</li>
  <li>vil2 will be renamed vil, and all code will be converted (using a simple 
  perl script.)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Possible improvements</h2>
<h4>Add a <code>get_pixel(void&nbsp;*buf,i,j)</code> and
<code>put_pixel(void&nbsp;*buf,i,j)</code> to <code>vil_image_resource.</code></h4>
<p>These might be useful for efficient implementation of some algorithms. They
could be implemented in terms of <code>get_copy_view(..)</code> and
<code>put_view(..)</code> in the base class. However, in some cases you need to
probe/set a pixel at a time and the overhead of allocating a <code>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;</code>
for each <code>get_view(..)</code> is quite expensive. Note that the cost of
allocating the <code>vil_memory_chunk</code> is irrelevant. If the image is
already in memory, no new <code>vil_memory_chunk</code> is allocated. If the
image isn't already in memory, the cost of the new memory chunk is smaller than
the disk access time. Note, one alternative may be to bring back the <code>
vil_image_resource::fill_view(...)</code> which modifies the contents of an existing
view and doesn't allocate any memory.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous Notes</h2>
<p>Pointers to data are often passed in as const, but may have the const removed.
This is because it is rather complicated to keep track of whether the data is going to be
changed or not.  Just try to be sensible, OK?</p>
