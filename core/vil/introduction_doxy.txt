/*! \mainpage vil2 : Proposed modifications of vil
* Provides a set of image data classes, derived from vil2_image_data, which act like a 
* restricted version of vil_image. Calling get_view will fill a vil_image_view<> and give it
* to you.
*
* Provides a set of image view classes, derived from vil2_image_view_base, which are 
* `views' on actual image data with known type in memory.
*
* The image views use pointer arithmetic to get at the pixel values, so store pointers
* to the start , and integers indicating how to get to neighbours in
* the x, y and plane directions.
*
* You can either have vil2_image_view<vil_rgb<vil_byte> > with nplanes() == 1
* or vil2_image_view<vil_byte> with nplanes() == 3, both pointing correctly
* at the same data.
*
* The advantages of this approach are
* - It is actually faster than pointer indirection on most architectures
* - It allows one to access non-contiguous data as if it is a single plane
* - One can use it to wrap up other image classes transparently.
* - It is simple to extend to 3D images, and avoids huge arrays of pointers
*
* \subsection CAVEAT User
* vil2 is a proposal. It may replace vil in part.
