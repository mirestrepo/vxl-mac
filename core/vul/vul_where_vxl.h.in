// \brief Allows cmake to set up macro giving name of VXL source root directory

// Note: The make system (eg cmake) should generate a file, vul_where_vxl.h, from
// this, in which the macro is set correctly.
// For non-cmake systems this might cause a problem.  In particular if there is
// no vul_where_vxl.h, some other stuff might not compile.
// If we supply a default vul_where_vxl.h, it would be changed by cmake, and
// may get checked back into the repository by accident.

#define VXL_SOURCE_ROOT_DIR "${allvxl_SOURCE_DIR}"
