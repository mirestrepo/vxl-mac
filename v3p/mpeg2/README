This directory hold MPEG2 source code, ported to VXL.

The original MPEG2 code comes from:
http://libmpeg2.sourceforge.net/files/mpeg2dec-0.2.1.tar.gz

The goals of this port were:
  Get mpeg2 and vo libraries to build in VXL, but not the executables.
  Copy a minimal number of files from the MPEG2 source tree.
  Modify a minimal number of the files so upgrades are easier.

Porting to VXL
--------------

The subset of files copied were:

  configure.in
  aclocal.m4
  acinclude.m4
  COPYING
  libmpeg2/*.[ch]
  libmpeg2/configure.incl
  libvo/*.[ch]
  libvo/configure.incl
  include/*.h
  include/config.h.in
  vc++/config.h
  vc++/inttypes.h

Directory vc++ was changes to win32.  The only files modified were:

  configure.in
  aclocal.m4
  config.h.in

For each of these files, the original was checked in to the CVS
repository first, then the changes were checked in.  The autoconf
configuration of mpeg2 was simplified since we are only building
libmpeg2 and libvo, and not installing.  Autoconf still created the
config.h file, but not the makefiles.

Rebuilding "configure"
----------------------

The source files for configure are:
  * configure.in
  * aclocal.m4
  * acinclude.m4
To rebuild configure, use these commands:

  cd $VXLSRC/v3p/mpeg2
  autoconf

configure gets committed to the CVS repository even though it is a
generated file.
