QV: a quick VRML parser
Version 1.0
Author: Paul S. Strauss of Silicon Graphics

------------------------

QV is an implementation of a VRML 1.0 parser that was created by
extracting the necessary classes and stuff from the Open Inventor
2.0.1 source.

------------------------

To compile the QV parser "library":

        cd src ; make

This will create QvLib.o, which contains everything in QV. (It should
be about 400K, including debugging information from the -g flag in
the Makefile.)

------------------------

To test QV parsing:

        cd test ; make readTest

Then, run it on the data file:

        ./readTest < AllNodes.wrl

The AllNodes.wrl file contains 1 of each supported node. It also has
an extender node or two to test that capability. If the parsing was
successful, the program prints "Read was ok". Otherwise, it prints
"Read was bad" after at least one more specific error message.

------------------------

To test QV traversal:

        cd test ; make travTest

Then, run it on the sample data file:

        ./travTest < AllNodes.wrl

This should print out each node type that is traversed and prints the
current traversal state at each shape node. This program uses the
sample traversal code found in src/QvTraverse.c++, which is intended
only as a demonstration of how traversal is implemented. VRML
developers may use this code as a basis for a real traversal
implementation.
