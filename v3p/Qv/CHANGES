This file documents changes made to QV between releases.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Version 0.0 to Version 1.0:
------------------------------------------------------------------

- Ignore flags in fields are gone.

- Added QvMFString class

- Added QvAsciiText class

- Added QvFontStyle class

- Removed trailing comma from last enum type in definition - some compilers
  prohibit it.

- Changed QvLevelOfDetail to QvLOD.

- Removed "NONE" from QvMaterialBinding and QvNormalBinding value enums.

- Added comments for QvTexture2 Wrap enum choices.

- Added "description" field to QvWWWAnchor.

- Added "valueHasConstructor" argument to QV_MFIELD_SOURCE() macro. This
  allows for multiple-value fields whose values need constructors to be
  called. (It uses new() instead of malloc(), which is a little slower
  but correct for these types.)

- Added reference counting and automatic deletion of nodes when reference
  count reaches zero.
