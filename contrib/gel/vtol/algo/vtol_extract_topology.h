//: Extracts the topology from a segmentation label image.
//
// This class contains the functionality to extract a set of regions
// from an image of region labels. Vertices are created only at
// junctions where possible. The edges connecting these vertices
// follow the boundary of the regions, and hence are often not
// straight lines.
//
// Vertices are formed at the corners of pixels, and edges are formed
// along the "cracks" between pixels. In this implementation, the
// vertices are indexed by the top-left corner of the pixel. That is,
// if the image has M x N pixels, it will have M+1 x N+1 vertices,
// indexed (0,0) to (M,N). A vertex (i,j) is positioned at
// (i-0.5,j-0.5) in pixel coordinates.
