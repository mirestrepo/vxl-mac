/*! \mainpage vepl1 : Easy Image Processing Library for vil1
* This library essentially just provides wrappers around the templated IP
* classes of the \c vipl library, but limited to images of type \c vil1_image .
*
* For every class in \c vipl , there is a function in \c vepl1 with the same
* name (after substituting "vipl" by "vepl1"), which returns a \c vil1_image,
* whose first argument is a \c vil1_image (the input image), and where the
* possible extra arguments are identical to the arguments of the constructor of
* the corresponding \c vipl class.
*
* To get an idea of how to use these functions, have a look at the example
* programs in \c tbl/vepl1/examples/ .  The examples are worked out, in the
* sense that they also take care of loading and saving the images and possibly
* reading the filter parameters from standard input.  Ignoring this, the use of
* a particular IP filter is just a single line: e.g.:
* \verbatim
*   vil1_image im1 = vil1_load("filename"); // assume "ubyte" image
*   vil1_image im2 = vepl1_gradient_mag(im1);
*   vil1_image im3 = vepl1_median(im2, 1.5); // median filter with radius 1.5
*   vil1_image im4 = vepl1_threshold(im3, 59,0,255); // binary clipping at 59
*   vil1_save(im4, "edges_image.pgm", "pnm");
* \endverbatim
