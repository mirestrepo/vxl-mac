/*! \mainpage mmn: Manchester Markov Network library
* Classes to represent markov networks (nodes with connections to
* neighbours).
* Includes algorithms to find the minimum of assignment problems
* of the form E = sum f(x(i)) + sum g(x(i),x(j))  where f(x) is
* a cost for assignment to a particular node, and g(x1,x2) is
* a pair-wise cost for neighbouring nodes.
*
* Where the graph defined by nodes and arcs is a tree structure,
* (ie acyclic) a variant of dynamic programming can efficiently
* find the minima.
*
* Where the graph has a limited number of closed loops, other
* fairly efficient algorithms can be used.
