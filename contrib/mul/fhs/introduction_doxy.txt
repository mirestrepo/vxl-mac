/*! \mainpage fhs : Feature matching using Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocker's method
* Classes to implement Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocker's elegant dynamic
* programming style approach to matching object part models to new images.
*
* A model consists of a set of feature detectors together with a tree
* structure describing the spacial relationships between the model points.
* The algorithm uses the vil_quadratic_distance_function applied to the
* feature response images to significantly reduce the complexity of search,
* leading to a fast method of locating the globally optimal positions of all
* model points.
*
* (See example in tests directory for usage).
