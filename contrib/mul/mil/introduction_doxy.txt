/*! \mainpage mil : Manchester's Image Library
* Provides a set of image classes, derived from mil_image, which can be used
* as `views' on actual image data.
*
* The images use pointer arithmetic to get at the pixel values, so store pointers
* to the start of each plane, and integers indicating how to get to neighbours in
* the x, y (and z) directions.
*
* The most commonly used class is likely to be mil_image_2d_of<T>, a templated
* multi-plane image.
*
* The advantages of this approach are
* - It is actually faster than pointer indirection on most architectures
* - It allows one to access non-contiguous data as if it is a single plane
* - One can use it to wrap up other image classes transparently.
* - It is simple to extend to 3D images, and avoids huge arrays of pointers
* - It allows 2D views of 3D images easily.
