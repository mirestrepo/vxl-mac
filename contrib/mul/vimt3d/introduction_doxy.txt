/*! \mainpage vimt3d : Polymorphic 3D image + transform library
* Provides a set of image classes, derived from vimt_image, which can be used
* as `registered views' on actual image data.
*
* The vimt classes use vil3d_image_view to provide that actual 3d images, and
* a vimt3d_transform_3d object to provide the registration.
*
* The most commonly used classes are likely to be vimt_image_3d_of<T>.
*
* \section pyr Image Pyramids
* Image pyramids (vimt_image_pyramid) are stacks of images, assumed to have lower
* resolution as one goes up the stack.
*
* They can be build using vimt_image_pyramid_builder objects such as
* - vimt3d_gaussian_pyramid_builder_3d
*
