/*! \mainpage vimt : Polymorphic image + transform library
* Provides a set of image classes, derived from vimt_image, which can be used
* as `views' on actual image data.
*
* The images use pointer arithmetic to get at the pixel values, so store pointers
* to the start of each plane, and integers indicating how to get to neighbours in
* the x, y (and z) directions.  See vil2_image_view.
*
* The most commonly used classes are likely to be vimt_image_2d_of<T> and
* vimt_image_3d_of<T> templated multi-plane images.
**
* \subsection pyr Image Pyramids
* Image pyramids (vimt_image_pyramid) are stacks of images, assumed to have lower
* resolution as one goes up the stack.
*
* They can be build using vimt_image_pyramid_builder objects such as
* - vimt_gaussian_pyramid_builder_2d
* - vimt_gaussian_pyramid_builder_2d_general
*
* \subsection Interp Interpolation
* Interpolation functions include
* - vimt_bilin_interp_2d (Fast interpolation with no checks on image size - seg fault if outside)
* - vimt_safe_bilin_interp_2d (Check inside image, if not, return zero)
* - vimt_safe_extend_bilin_interp_2d (Bilinear, if outside return value at nearest edge pixel)
*
* \subsection Sampling Sampling
* Profiles can be sampled using vimt_sample_profile_2d
*
