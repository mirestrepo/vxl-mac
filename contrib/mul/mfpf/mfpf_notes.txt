To Do:
- Compute sensible limits and steps for the simplex optimisation
  in mfpf_point_finder::refine_match (depends on size of object
- radius() currently defined in model units - should it be in world
  units?
- Tune refine_match algorithm 
   - Probably using too many iterations at present.

- May need to do more work to group similar responses together
  - How similar is similar?  If centre of one within the other?

- Double check the inside fn - seems to be failing occasionally.

- * Problem with vpdfl_pc_gaussian - not very sensible implementation
    (ie builds full square eigenvector matrix.  Fix this!)
