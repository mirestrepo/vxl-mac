<h1>How to manage the loading process</h1>

<h2>Ideal</h2>
<h3>Use cases</h3>

<ol>

  <li>Filename is in the filesystem namespace. Fileformat identified by file contents.</li>
  <li>Filename implies a set of files. Files are in the filesystem. The
existence of the files triggers full attempt to load files. The file
contents confirm the filetype.</li>
  <li>Filename is URL. The file contents identify format.</li>
  <li>URL
implies a set of files. The existence of the resources triggers full
attempt to load files. The file contents confirm the filetype.</li>
  <li>Filename describes image in entirety</li>
  <li>A loader plugin can take a filestream.</li>
  <li>A loader plugin can take a filename, and recursively issue another load command</li>
  <li>A loader plugin may need to know the filename while taking a filestream?</li>
</ol>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Several lists of loaders.</p>

<ol>

  <li>First list decides what to do purely on basis of filename, and includes.

  <ol>
    <li>filename encoded image loader</li>
    <li>Image cache plugins</li>
    <li>URL Loader loads into memory, and passes stream to level 2</li>
    <li>File loader creates file stream, and passes to level 2</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Second List takes stream and filename.
  <ol>
    <li>Simple file format loaders.</li>
    <li>File format loader that then needs to load subsequent files</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Practical</h2>

<p>This is getting too messy. Instead we will start with a single list of loaders,
that will each get a chance to load an image based on a filepath.</p>

<h3>Use cases</h3>
<p> That should allow the following use cases.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Filename is in the filesystem namespace. Fileformat identified by file contents.</li>
  <li>Filename implies a set of files. Files are in the filesystem. The
existence of the files triggers full attempt to load files. The file
contents confirm the filetype.</li>
  <li>Filename is URL. The file contents identify format.</li>
  <li>Filename describes image in entirety</li>
</ol>
