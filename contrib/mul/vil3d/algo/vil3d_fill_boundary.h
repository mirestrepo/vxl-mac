// \author Kola Babalola

//: Compute a mask where the regions in each slice of a 3D image bounded by contours are set to "on"
#include <vil3d/vil3d_image_view.h>

//: Compute 3d distance transform from zeros in original image.
//  Image is assumed to be filled with max_dist where there is
//  background, and zero at the places of interest. On exit,
//  the values are the 8-connected distance to the nearest
//  original zero voxel.
