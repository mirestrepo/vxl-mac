/*! \mainpage vpdfl : Multivariate Probability Density Function Library
* Provides several classes for representing and using multivariate probability
* density functions (PDFs).
*
* Each PDF comes as a builder-model-sampler triplet of objects.
*
* e.g. The abstract PDF base classes
* - vpdfl_builder_base
* - vpdfl_pdf_base
* - vpdfl_pdf_sampler
*
* The multivariate Gaussian PDF classes
*
* - vpdfl_axis_gaussian_builder
* - vpdfl_axis_gaussian
* - vpdfl_axis_gaussian_sampler
*
* The builders are used to compute the model data (eg the means, variances etc)
* for the models.
*
* The models are used to calculate densities, cumulative probabilities, gradients, etc.
*
* Samplers are used to generate samples from a given model.
*
* The samples are produced with a PDF given by its model.
