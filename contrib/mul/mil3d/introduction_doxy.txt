/*! \mainpage mil3d : Manchester's 3D Image Library
* Provides a set of image classes, derived from mil_image, which can be used
* as `views' on actual image data in 3D.
*
* The images use pointer arithmetic to get at the pixel values, so store pointers
* to the start of each plane, and integers indicating how to get to neighbours in
* the x, y and z directions.
*
* The most commonly used class is likely to be mil_image_3d_of<T>, a templated
* multi-plane image.
