This package contains the Manchester public not-quite VXL library.
Current contents
mbl   Some basic stuff needed by the Manchester libraries.
vpdfl   Multivariate PDF objects, builders, samplers, etc.
mil     Our own image library. We will use the vil library as soon as
        it is rewritten to use pointer arithmetic rather than pointer
        indexing for addressing.
