This package contains the Manchester public not-quite VXL library.
Current contents
mbl     Some basic stuff needed by the Manchester libraries.
vpdfl   Multivariate PDF objects, builders, samplers, etc.

        it is rewritten to use pointer arithmetic rather than pointer
        indexing for addressing.
clsfy   Statistical classifiers, and training algorithms.
