/*! \mainpage m23d : Manchester's Library for Generating 3D models from 2D data
* Various functions for generating linear models of 3D point positions
* and their variation, given multiple 2D views.
*
* Initial classes assume orthographic projection models, and that all points
* are visible in all frames.  Note that the Oxford libraries contain more
* well developed tools for dealing with tracking of rigid objects under
* projective projections.
