 - Not fully tested yet
 - make_pure_projections needs work to ensure each row has scaled version of the same matrix
   - There may be a problem when calculating this due to the possible z-ambiguity?
   - Perhaps that should be resolved first
     - Having fixed ambiguity for mode 0, can we propogate it to
       subsequent modes by checking the relevant z columns of P?
       (Need to take scaling factors into account, which may be -ive)

- compute_correction() on pure P produces noisy result
  - identity is a solution to Aq=rhs
  - However, found solution is worse.
  - there is ambiguity due to near zero eigenvalues
  - Allowing for this still produces a poor result (unclear why)
