The initial import of the Otago University library. Contains:
ouel: Otago Uni Estimation Library (currently only Kalman Filter)
oufgl: Otago Uni Frame Grabber Library (pxc200 for linux)
ouml: Otago Uni Misc Library (eigenfaces, image_database, polygon_mesh)

Hasn't been fully tested using the latest release of vxl but should work
with only minor mods as it works OK with vxl-1.0-beta.
