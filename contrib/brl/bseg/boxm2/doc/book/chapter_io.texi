IO and cache for boxm2 data structures.  
@endchapsummary

The 3d image library has been built on top of the new @vxl{} imaging library
vil. vil3d behaves just like vil and offers a similar range of services.
Indeed vil3d uses large parts of vil to provide data management, pixel type,
and other aspects of the API.
