      - Remove vcl_complex hackery on MSVC 6. vcl_complex is now the
        standard <complex>, since it seems to work with VC6sp5.

      - vnl_numeric_limits is deprecated in favour of vcl_numeric_limits.
        (vnl_numeric_limits was written before vcl. vcl_numeric_limits is now
         more robust, and can use platform defaults.)
      - vbl_basic_tuple, vbl_basic_relation, etc. are deprecated since we have
        no decent explanation of how to use them.
