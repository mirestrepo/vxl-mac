# Find the native PNG includes and library

# This module defines
# PNG_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find png.h, etc.
# PNG_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against to use PNG.
# PNG_DEFINITIONS - You should ADD_DEFINITONS(${PNG_DEFINITIONS}) before compiling code that includes png library files.
# PNG_FOUND, If false, do not try to use PNG.

# also defined, but not for general use are
# PNG_LIBRARY, where to find the PNG library.

# None of the above will be defined unles zlib can be found.

# PNG depends on Zlib
