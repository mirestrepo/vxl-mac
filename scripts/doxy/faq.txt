Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

1) How do I get stuff to appear on the main page of the Doxygen output?

Add a file called <introduction_doxy.txt> to your library.
For example, the one in vnl looks like this:

	// The following text is included in the main documentation page by doxygen
	/*! \mainpage vnl : Numeric Library
	* The numerics library, vnl is intended to provide an environment for numerical
	* programming which combines the ease of use of packages like Mathematica and
	* Matlab with the speed of C and the elegance of C++.
	* It provides a C++ interface to the high-quality Fortran routines made available
	* in the public domain by numerical analysis researchers.
	*
	* This release includes classes for
	* - Matrices and Vectors (including specialised classes for particular forms)
	* - Matrix decompositions
	* - Polynomials
	* - Optimization
	* - Common functions (in vnl_math)
	*/

2) How do I get a brief description of my library to appear on the main index page?

Add the <introduction_doxy.pl> file to your library (see (1) above).
The gen_doxy_index.pl tool looks for the text following \mainpage and uses
that on the index page.
