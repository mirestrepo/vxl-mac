# define the libraries and package dependencies for doc generation
# Format:
# Package Library Prefix [build/ignore]
#  - If the last field is "ignore" the library will not be built,
#    but will be considered when building a list of dependencies.
# Each library is assumed to depend on those preceding it (for the
# purpose of building links between libraries in the html).
