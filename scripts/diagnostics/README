Tools to help diagnose problems with vxl etc

vxl_run_tests.pl -d base_dir -o output_dir [-e exe_dir] [-r depth]
------------------------------------------------------------------
Runs all the executables it finds in `tests' directories below a given
base directory.
It generates some nice html tables summarising the output, including links to files containing
the actual output for each programme.

It's very useful for checking if everything is working, and if not, what is failing.

It can be used on any test suites that conform to the vxl styles (eg those in your own libraries).


Try, for instance:

vxl_run_tests.pl -d $VXLBIN/vxl -o /tmp/vxl_output -r 1

(on unix).

Then look at /tmp/vxl_output/index.html
