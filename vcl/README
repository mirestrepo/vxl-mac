header names
------------
There's a list of ISO headers in headers.iso; each ISO header <blah> becomes
<vcl/vcl_blah.h> and there should not be any other headers here. Exceptions are:

vcl_compiler.h
  Every other header file in this directory should include this file.
  That's a requirement and it's service which clients can rely on; thus
  if you include <vcl/vcl_iostream.h> you *don't* need to include 
  <vcl/vcl_compiler.h> even if you need the macros defined in there.

vcl_complex_fwd.h
  In ISO C++, the complex template class can be forward declared with
    namespace std { template <class T> class complex; }
  so there is no need for a forward declaration header. In VXL C++, the
  complex class might be called anything from std::complex<T> to plain
  old vcl_complex<T>, so we do need a forward declaration header.

vcl_unistd.h>
  <unistd.h> is part of the POSIX standard, not ISO. Since it's so useful to 
  have and so broken on most systems, we supply vcl_unistd.h

vcl_stlfwd.h
  Forward declare the most commonly used parts of the STL, if possible.

vcl_rtti.h
  Under construction. For rtti emulation with compilers that don't support
  rtti.

vcl_deprecated.h
  Including this causes preprocessor or compiler warning to be emitted. So
  include <vcl/vcl_deprecated.h> in header files that are to be deprecated.

vcl_alloc.h
  No ISO <alloc>. Use vcl_memory.h for vcl_allocator<>.


template files
--------------
This is an unofficial codification of existing practice, as observed by fsm.
~       is for pointer
+       is for < in templates
-       is for > in templates
.       is for the commas between template arguments
_ or __ is for the :: in nested classe (which is preferred?)
The abbreviations uchar, ushort, uint, ulong stand for unsigned versions of 
integer types. Use 's' as a prefix for signed versions. Beware that 'char'
is signed on some machines, so if there's an instance for 'signed char', 
adding one for 'char' might cause conflicts. (But gcc 2.95 seems to make a
distinction between 'char', 'signed char' and 'unsigned char' which is very
strange).
